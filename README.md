# AI Engineering with .NET & Python

This repository documents my journey of designing **production-grade AI systems**
using **Python for AI/ML** and **.NET for scalable, enterprise backends**, with an
**Azure-first** approach.

## Why this repo?
Most AI examples stop at model demos.
This repo focuses on **systems**:
- architecture
- tradeoffs
- scalability
- cost
- security
- observability

## Structure
Each folder maps to a LinkedIn post and covers:
- concepts
- architecture
- Python examples
- .NET examples
- production notes
